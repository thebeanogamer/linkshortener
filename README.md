This project is an over-engineered Link Shortener built using as many AWS services as was reasonably possible. An example deployment of this is available on <https://beano.dev>.

## Usage

### Deploy

Before running the deployment, you must manually create a certificate for your domain in `us-east-1` and configure SES and Route 53 in a region of your choice. Unless you request a usage limit increase from AWS, you will need to manually [verify your email](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization-identity-owner-tasks-verification.html) within SES. You will also need to set the following environment variables on the deploying machine.

Variable | Value
--- | ---
`ADMIN_CONTACT` | The email address for updates to be sent to
`DOMAIN` | The domain your shortener will be hosted on
`FALLBACK_URL` | The URL to redirect to in the absence of a specifically defined one
`REGION` | The region to deploy to
`SES_REGION` | The region where you have configured SES

```bash
npm install
serverless create_domain --stage prod # This only needs to be run once but may take up to 40 mins
serverless deploy --stage prod
```

### Database

The database used is DynamoDB, below can be seen an example record which would redirect from `/blog` to `https://blog.daniel-milnes.uk`.

```json
{
  "code": "blog",
  "url": "https://blog.daniel-milnes.uk",
  "uses": {
    "lifetime": 0,
    "recent": 0
  }
}
```

### Emails

Link Shortener tracks two values for usage, `lifetime` and `recent`. The `recent` key is cleared every time a usage summary is generated. A summary will be sent to the email defined in the `ADMIN_CONTACT` environment variable every 24 hours when there has been use, or when an authorized user POSTs to `/email`. The email can also be previewed on `/email`.
